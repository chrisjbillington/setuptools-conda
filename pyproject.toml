# Since setuptools-conda uses itself (from the source directory) to build itself, this
# is the full list of our run-time requirements. Of course, pip will not be able to
# install these conda dependencies and we don't want it to - this package should be
# built with "python -m setuptools_conda build .", not with 'pip wheel' or anything
# else.
